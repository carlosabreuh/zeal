### Donations and Assistance 

#### Zeal is a one stop finder for local resources that can assist those who want to donate for a noble cause.  With Zeal, you can search local charities by Zipcode, where you will find the address of the organization, and also be able to save charities of your choice.  

#### In the Home page, you will find static websites that will allow you to expand your search for either Shelter, Clothing, Food and also places where donations are being accepted. 

##### In the Resource section, you'll find the tool where you can find local charities by entering the zip.

        ### Lingering challenges
        * API will not grab URL from Charity when available, but rather the profile URL. 
        * Ways to filer results after entering Zipcode
        

        ### Future Items
        * OAuth with AWS
        * Allow the user to enter the and search, but Register/Login when Saving a charity
        * Able to send the charity to a friend
        * Preserve the saved items based on user login
        * Use multiple APIs for different causes

        ###Future Ideas
        * Partner with other organizations to come and get the donations and drop them to the desired charity. 
        * Create an interactive map that shows the locations using Google Maps API
        * Mobile App /  AppStore
